##  C-Vac/asteroids: A Pygame-Powered Odyssey

Embark on an exhilarating voyage through the treacherous expanse of the cosmos with Cosmic Calamity, a meticulously crafted Asteroids clone that will test your reflexes, your spatial awareness, and your capacity for enduring repetitive gameplay.  

Harnessing the versatile Pygame library, this application delivers an authentic Asteroids experience, replete with pixelated graphics, rudimentary sound effects, and a relentless barrage of celestial debris that will challenge even the most seasoned spacefarer.

### **Key Features:**

* **Authentic Asteroids Gameplay:**  Faithfully recreates the classic Asteroids experience, complete with a lone spaceship, a relentless onslaught of asteroids, and the ever-present threat of imminent destruction.
* **Pygame-Powered Performance:**  Leverages the Pygame library for seamless graphics rendering, responsive controls, and immersive sound effects, ensuring a captivating (albeit visually underwhelming) gameplay experience.
* **Challenging Difficulty:**  Tests your reflexes and spatial awareness with progressively challenging waves of asteroids, each one determined to reduce your spaceship to pixelated dust.
* **Minimalist Design:**  Embraces a minimalist aesthetic, eschewing unnecessary visual flourishes and focusing on the core gameplay elements, ensuring a distraction-free (and arguably visually unappealing) experience.
* **Abrupt Termination:**  Provides a refreshingly concise gameplay experience, terminating abruptly upon collision with an asteroid, freeing you from the burden of prolonged gameplay and the illusion of progress.

###  Comprehensive Game Guide

Mastering the intricacies of Cosmic Calamity requires a delicate balance of finesse, anticipation, and a healthy dose of luck.  Consult this comprehensive guide to navigate the treacherous depths of asteroid-infested space:

#### **Controls:**

*   **A/D:**  Rotate your spaceship with the grace of a drunken asteroid.
*   **W/S:**  Propel your spaceship through the cosmic void, or use 'S' to come to a screeching halt, leaving yourself vulnerable to those pesky asteroids.
*   **Space:** Unleash a barrage of laser fire, your only defense against the relentless onslaught of celestial debris.

#### **Asteroid Types:**

*   **Large Asteroids:**  These behemoths of the cosmos are slow and lumbering, but their sheer size makes them a formidable threat. Watch out for their dash ability, which can catch unsuspecting players off guard.
*   **Medium Asteroids:**  These agile adversaries are faster and more maneuverable than their larger counterparts, posing a constant threat to your spaceship's fragile hull.
*   **Small Asteroids:**  These nimble nuisances are the bane of every spacefarer's existence. Their erratic movements and sheer numbers make them a constant challenge to avoid.

#### **Gameplay Tips:**

*   **Conserve Ammunition:**  Your laser fire is limited, so make each shot count. Don't waste precious ammunition on asteroids that pose no immediate threat.
*   **Anticipate Asteroid Trajectories:**  Those asteroids may seem to move randomly, but there's a method to their madness. Learn to anticipate their trajectories and navigate accordingly.
*   **Embrace the Chaos:**  Cosmic Calamity is a game of chaos and chance. Don't get discouraged if you meet an untimely demise. Just respawn and try again, armed with the knowledge gained from your previous failures.

## Most Requested Features (Please Don't Email Me About These)

While Cosmic Calamity is a complete and meticulously crafted game, the overwhelming demand for additional features has forced me, the stressed-out developer, to acknowledge the following:

*   **High Scores:**  A leaderboard to track your pathetic attempts at survival.
*   **Ultra Lazer Boost Powerup:**  A powerup that obliterates all asteroids on screen, but also has a tendency to crash the application and potentially corrupt your operating system.

A new update is currently in development, but please, I implore you, do not email me about these features.  I am but one developer, struggling to keep up with the overwhelming demand for enhanced gameplay and bug fixes.  Your patience (and lack of emails) is greatly appreciated.
